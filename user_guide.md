## Tips & Tricks

### Keyboard Shortcuts

You can assign keyboard shortcuts to any of the commands through Obsidian's Hotkeys settings:

1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Hotkeys
2. Search for "Update Dates"
3. Click the + icon next to any command to assign a shortcut

### Combining with Tasks Plugin

When used with the Tasks Plugin, you can:

- Use Update Dates to reschedule overdue tasks
- Use Tasks queries to find tasks that need attention
- Combine both plugins for powerful task management

### Date Formats

- The plugin recognizes dates in YYYY-MM-DD format
- It supports both plain dates and dates with emoji prefixes (üìÖ, ‚è≥, üõ´)
- It can handle Tasks Plugin's special formatting for recurring tasks (üîÅ)

### Bulk Operations

- To update many tasks at once, process an entire folder rather than individual files
- Use specific filters to target exactly the tasks you want to modify
- Save commonly used configurations in the plugin settings as defaults

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **No dates are being highlighted**
  - Check that your dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format
  - Verify that the dates are actually in the past
  - Ensure your task format matches what the plugin expects

- **Some tasks are being skipped**
  - Check your filter settings - you may have filters that exclude these tasks
  - Verify that excluded folders aren't catching more files than intended

- **Error processing folder**
  - Double-check that the folder path is correct
  - Ensure you have proper permissions to modify files in that folder
